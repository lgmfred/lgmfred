- 👋 Oh Hi, I’m Ayiko Fred (@lgmfred).
- 👀 I’m interested in building bistributed, fault-tolerant, scalable, soft real-time & highly available systems. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Elixir (having learnt some basic Erlang, I love it!).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on, well uh, any thing BEAM related (mostly to learn more).
- 📫 I'm pretty much @lgmfred everywhere on the internet
