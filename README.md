- 👋 Oh Hi, I’m Ayiko Fred.
- 👀 I’m interested in building massively scalable soft real-time systems with requirements on high availability.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Erlang & Elixir (I'm loving it!).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on, well uh, any thing BEAM related (mostly for me to learn).
- 📫 I'm pretty much **`@lgmfred`** everywhere on the internet, even on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lgmfred/).
